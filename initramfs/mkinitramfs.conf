# This file contains the list of modules to be loaded by the initramfs.
# One module per line without extension.

# The list of modules can be defined like this:
#   for i in `lsinitcpio /boot/initramfs-linux.img | grep .ko`; do basename "$i" .ko; done

# After defining or changing the list, re-generate the initramfs like this:
#   mkinitramfs linux
#   mkinitramfs linux-lts
